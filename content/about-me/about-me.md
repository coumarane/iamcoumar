# About Me
👋 Hi, I'm Coumarane Couppane, a passionate and experienced DevOps Cloud Engineer with over 15 years in IT, specializing in designing and deploying robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructures.

I’ve built my career across a range of roles—from solution architect to DevOps lead—spanning industries like energy, finance, insurance, legal services, and e-commerce. My recent work includes delivering Infrastructure-as-Code solutions on Microsoft Azure, automating CI/CD pipelines, and supporting production-grade Kubernetes environments.

I'm a strong advocate of automation, DevSecOps best practices, and continuous learning. Whether it's Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, or Azure DevOps, I believe in leveraging the right tools to build reliable platforms that empower developers and deliver value fast.

Some technologies and frameworks I frequently use:

* ☁️ Cloud & DevOps: Azure, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Bash

* 🖥️ Languages: Python, C#, Java, Bash

* 💻 Frontend: Angular, ReactJS

* 🧠 Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, CosmosDB

🛠️ CI/CD: Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Jenkins

I hold multiple Microsoft Azure certifications (Fundamentals, Developer, DevOps Engineer), and I’m always looking for exciting challenges and opportunities to innovate.

When I’m not working on cloud infrastructure, I enjoy exploring new technologies, gaming, and traveling. Welcome to my blog, where I share insights, tutorials, and thoughts on tech and beyond.
